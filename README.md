# Apple Stock Price Analysis and Prediction
## Project Overview
This project analyzes and predicts Apple stock prices using a hybrid modeling approach that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Linear Regression. By leveraging historical stock data, the project aims to uncover patterns, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and forecast future stock prices with improved accuracy. The project also visualizes key trends and evaluates the performance of predictive models, providing insights for financial analysis and decision-making.

## Objectives
- Analyze historical stock price data using EDA techniques to identify trends and patterns.
- Develop and evaluate a hybrid predictive model combining LSTM and Linear Regression to forecast stock prices.
- Visualize stock trends and prediction results for clear insights.
- Provide an end-to-end framework for stock price analysis and prediction using Python.

## Hybrid Model for Prediction
Model Components
- LSTM Network: Captured temporal dependencies and trends in sequential stock price data.
- Linear Regression: Complemented LSTM predictions by modeling linear relationships in the data.
Workflow
- Preprocessed data into training and test datasets suitable for time-series forecasting.
- Trained LSTM and Linear Regression models on historical data.
- Combined predictions from both models to create a hybrid forecast.
- Assessed model accuracy using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Tools and Technologies
Python: Core programming language for data analysis and modeling.
TensorFlow & Keras: Frameworks for building and training LSTM networks.
Scikit-learn: For implementing Linear Regression and evaluating model performance.
Pandas & NumPy: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
